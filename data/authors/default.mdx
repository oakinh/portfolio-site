Former technical sourcer turned engineer who delivers production‑ready TypeScript/Python systems, geospatial data pipelines, and SEO-scale APIs. Comfortable owning features end‑to‑end - from architecture and SQL to analytics instrumentation - while communicating clearly with executives and cross‑functional partners. Public speaker and lifelong learner who thrives on tough, ambiguous challenges.

Professionally, I code in Typescript and Javascript, and in my off hours I like to dive lower level and build projects in C and C++.

I'm also doing a lot of learning around operating systems, computer architecture, and networking.

When I am not typing away at a computer, you will find me powerlifting, reading a book, or spending time with my wife and son.
